The Red Room~
It takes you a moment to realize that the red glow here is
coming from a round portal on the floor. It looks almost as
if someone had painted a picture of a dirt running through a
field on the floor of this room. Oddly enough, it is so
realistic you can feel the wind in the field coming out of the
picture.

It looks as if you could go down into it... but you can?t be
sure of where you will end up, or if you can get back.
